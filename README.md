# Scraping My ConvertKit Data
I've killed off the two newsletters I've run over the last year.
Even though I'm done with them, I don't want to lose the data
I have.

So using ConvertKit's API, I've written some python scripts to
scrap the data into json files and store it in my files.

Nothing crazy's going on here.

But if you're interested in the API scraping code I wrote, feel
free to check it out above.
